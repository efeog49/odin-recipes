    <h2>Juicy Italian chicken thighs topped with a flavorful three-cheese blend.</h2>
    <p>These juicy Italian chicken thighs are topped with a flavorful three-cheese blend and your favorite marinara sauce. Serve them over pasta, rice, or with roasted potatoes for a delicious weeknight meal. I prefer shredding my own cheese for better melting, but pre-shredded works well to save time.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup low-fat ricotta cheese</li>

        <li>¼ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        
        <li>½ teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
        
        <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
        
        <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs</li>
        
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        
        <li>1 ½ cups marinara sauce</li>
        
        <li>¾ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Combine ricotta cheese, Parmesan cheese, Italian seasoning, and salt in a small bowl; set aside.</li>
        <li>Season chicken thighs on both sides with garlic powder and salt.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in an oven-proof skillet over medium-high heat. Cook chicken thighs, smooth-side down, in hot oil until the bottoms are browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip thighs over and remove the skillet from heat. Top each thigh with an equal amount of ricotta cheese mixture. Spoon marinara sauce on top and around chicken thighs.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the centers of thighs should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Top each thigh with mozzarella cheese and continue baking until cheese is melted, 2 to 3 minutes. Garnish with parsley to serve.</li>
    </ol>
